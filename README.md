# THINKFUL_3.4.3
Testing code

There is something wrong line 35 of this code - I have gprof2dot.py on my machine and have installed GraphViz, but the script doesn't seem to perform correctly.

I also tried applying this check to a more rigorous code (such as the the API code we worked on last week), but one of the intermediary scripts that I ran seemed to semi-permenantly store the fizzbuzz output as for the unittest function.
